   <h2> Reason for joining Code Nation</h2>
   <p> I have always had an interest in software development, I studied IT in college but never furthered my Education and ended up moving into the construction industry,
       then on to the engineering industry. While in lockdown it gave me a chance to think what i really want to do in life, which is to work in the tech industry in development.
        I completed the threee week course and really enjoyed it, and would like to further build my knowledge and experience so i am able to seek employment as a software developer.
